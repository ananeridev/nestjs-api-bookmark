Removes stopped service containers.

By default, anonymous volumes attached to containers will not be removed. You
can override this with `-v`. To list all volumes, use `docker volume ls`.

Any data which is not in a volume will be lost.

Usage: rm [options] [--] [SERVICE...]

Options:
    -f, --force   Don't ask to confirm removal
    -s, --stop    Stop the containers, if required, before removing
    -v            Remove any anonymous volumes attached to containers
    -a, --all     Deprecated - no effect.
